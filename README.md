# Ontario-Tech-Programming-Workshop-1
All my Programming Workshop 1 (CSCI 1060U) labs

### Lab 1
Just an introduction, mostly just making sure that environment is set up correctly.

### Lab 2
##### Part 1
A game where the computer generates a 3 digit number and you guess the digits until you get it right.
##### Part 2
Extension of the previous game, now with you creating a number as well and the computer trying to guess it.

### Lab 3
##### Part 1
A program that prints a calendar in an easy to read format.
##### Part 2
Extension of part 1, where now a user should be able to intput any month or year and get a calendar of that month or year.

### Lab 4
##### Part 1
Introduction to reading a file.
##### Part 2
Extension of part 1, where in addition to reading the contents of the file, the program also counts the number of upper and lower case letters as well as the number numeric characters.

### Lab 5
##### Part 1
Code was provided in the most painful and unreadable form possible. The job was essentially to format and comment the code so that it is legible.
##### Part 2
A program that takes an input from the user in the form of (Street, City, Province, Postal Code, Country) and then extracts each individual piece.

### Lab 6
A program that takes the marks of 10 students, sorts those marks using Bubble Sort, and outputs the students that passed as well as the number that passed or failed.

### Lab 7
A game of Connect4. A lot of the code was provided, but the isWinner function was incomplete and needed to be finished.

### Lab 8
Practice with pointers
##### Part 1
Write code that would help figure out the size of an int and double using pointer arithmetic.
##### Part 2
Code was provided with a non-functional swap_pointers function. Error had to be diagnosed and fixed.

### Lab 9
Practice with classes
##### Part 1
Program that implements Circle and Square classes.
##### Part 2
Program that implements a RegularPolygon class, similar to the Circle and Square classes from part 1, but for any number of sides.

### Lab 10
Program that implements a Stack class to figure out if a given word is a palindrome or not.
